## Wy is it free ?
Originally the bot was paid but it is hard to manage order, en ensure support.
For now it become free to use just include a really small fee on transaction.

### Transparency 
For example if you buy for 30$ of a token you will get 0.4$ of fee 
If you buy for 140$ of a token you will get 2$ of fee 

more you buy less are the fee, this is just to support the dev bot. Glade if you can continue to participate
